<h1>First, do the groundwork</h1>
<p class="quote">In order to obtain the framework for the practice of dharma, this precious human existence, which, in being free and well favored, offers excellent opportunities, one must practice excellent virtue, since this is its karmic seed.</p>
<p>There are two points here, the groundwork for a period of meditation and groundwork instructions.</p>
<p>First, at the beginning of every period of meditation, imagine your root guru sitting on a lotus-and-moon seat above your head. His body is radiant and his face happy and smiling as he regards all beings with nonreferential compassion. In him, all the root and lineage gurus are present.</p>

<h1>In daily life, be a child of illusion</h1>
<p class="quote">After meditation, do not allow the experience of resting evenly to dissipate, no matter what form of activity you engage in.</p>
<p>Continually foster the feeling of knowing that all appearances, yourself, others, animate, or inanimate, appear though they seem to be nothing - be like a child of illusion.</p>
<p>Second, meditation on relative bodhicitta is explained in three parts: teachings on the preparation, on the actual practice, and on postmeditation practice.</p>
